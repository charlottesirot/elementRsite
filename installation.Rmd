There is so far two ways to download elementR:

- [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=elementR)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/charlottesirot/elementR)

<br />


# Before installation

<br />

1. Check the version of R installed on your computer (`sessionInfo()`), must be â‰¥ 3.2.3, see [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) to update your version.

2. __For Mac users only__: elementR package needs XQuartz. Please check, that XQuartz is installed and runs properly on your computer. If not, please visit [https://www.xquartz.org/](https://www.xquartz.org/).


<br />

# Installation

<br />

The easiest way to get elementR is to install it from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=elementR):

```
install.packages("elementR", dependencies = T)
library(elementR)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version (not yet pushed on cran) from [GitHub](https://github.com/charlottesirot/elementR) :

```
#Install elementR's dependencies
pkgs <- c("gdata", "shiny","devtools", "shinyjs", "gnumeric", "R6", "shinydashboard",
	"abind", "stringr", "lmtest", "tcltk", "tcltk2", "reader", "readODS", "readxl", "outliers", "climtrends",
	"EnvStats", "colourpicker", "zoo", "httpuv")

invisible(lapply(pkgs, function(pkgs){
	if(!require(pkgs)){
		install.packages(pkgs, dependencies=TRUE)
	}
}))

#Install elementR
devtools::install_github("charlottesirot/elementR", ref = "master", force = T, dependencies = T)

library(elementR)
```
<br />

# Notes on installation

<br />

For Mac users: during installation elementR will ask to install "XCode/otool". Accept this installation.

If the installation is stuck at the installation of the tcltk package, this probably means that XQuartz does not run properly. Check its validity.

For Linux users: you could need to install additional libraries: 

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev
```

the elementR GUI runs on any web browser. However, as the graphic of the user interface has been developed based on Firefox, authors highly recommend to run elementR under [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

<br />

# Usage

<br />

To launch elementR, run the following command in your R console:

```
runElementR()
```
